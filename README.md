> Academically, I'm an AI/ML researcher studying head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and LLM grading and testing. In the past, I've studied the effects of nicotine exposure on epigenetic age acceleration and Ferrell's Inequality with composite cellular signaling reactions. Though improving AI tools and workflows is a big passion of mine, at my core, I'm a computer scientist who wants to help others through web development. You can check out some of my projects below!
