# About Reagan

> **ðŸ’¡ Important**
> 
> **Hey, I'm Reagan!**
> 
> I build AI/ML systems that solve real-world problems and make technology more accessible. Day-to-day I'm in the Python and TensorFlow trenches, training deep learning models for medical imaging, developing LLM benchmarking frameworks, and contributing to [AI research publications](https://github.com/Cheggin) and [open-source ML tools](https://github.com/Cheggin?tab=repositories). Beyond research, I architect data processing pipelines and orchestration systems, and specialize in building scalable cross-platform applications for production environments. I live in the CLI, and am the creator of award-winning hackathon projects!
